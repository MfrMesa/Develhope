    <h1>Recipe for Chocolate Cake</h1>
    <article>
    <p>
        This perfect combination of oil, milk and boiling water makes this recipe stand out without having to use melted chocolate.</br> 
    </br> 
        The fats in the oil, protein in milk and temperature of the water makes the chocolate flavour develop nicely while baking </br> 
        and providing the essentials for that moist crumb you're looking for.</br> 
    </br> 
        Don't over-mix OR over-bake. This chocolate cake only needs about 30-35 minutes in the oven, or until a wooden skewer inserted </br> 
        into the centre comes out clean. </br> 
    </br> 
        Make sure you preheat your oven before starting. We've included temperatures for standard AND fan or convention ovens.</br>
        If using springform pans, note that they are NOT 100% leakproof. Very thin cake batters such as this one will leak through the base.</br> 
    </br> 
        To combat this issue, line the base with parchment paper coming up where the sides meets the base to create a "cover". </br>
        Place a baking sheet on the shelf below the cake pan (or the bottom of the oven) to catch any stray drips. Don't put cake pans directly </br>
        on the pan as the heat will effect the base of your cakes.</br>
    </br> 
        Let cakes cool COMPLETELY before frosting. You can make this chocolate cake the day before and frost the next day.</br>
